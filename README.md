Alternative firmware for Cacazi doorbell
===
<img alt="the doorbell guts" src="doorbell_guts.jpg" style="width:300px">

This firmware is written for the ATTiny412 and requires the original MCU to be replaced.
The functionality is almost identical to the original, with added support for HT12 style remotes.
The MCU is the bottom 8 pins chip, pin 1 is the uppermost on the right.
